# Quantum Untangled
This project aims to make quantum computing accessible to people of all ages. We want to bring the basics of quantum mechanics and quantum computing to a wider public. We intend to do this through a website that will work as a hub for all-things quantum. The website is still under development now, but expect a working version by the end of 2020. 
## About us 
We are students of The Coding School’s Qubit by Qubit: Introduction to Quantum Computing course. We decided to start this project to promote the field of quantum, since we noticed that it is hard to get into it due to the math and physics requirements to understand most concepts. 
## Contributing
To contribute to the project, please open an issue describing the feature you want to implement or the bug that needs to be fixed. The issue will be reviewed and a pull request will be opened next. In order to modify the code in your computer, you will need to first set up the Django framework and a virtual environment. Instructions for doing that can be found here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/install/
